This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


### `About the project`

  The project is a Todo List in which you have two prompts(questions), the first being necessary and the second being an optional one meant to make the response to the first question much clearer. The first prompt is "What task would you like to add?" and the second prompt is "Details for the task". 
  After these two are filled out you must click the "Add" button to add the new task onto the list. After this is done the list item will be shown along with the two default tasks "Sleep" and "Eat". Besides adding tasks the tasks have several states that they can have such as being completed which is displayed with the checkbox being clicked and tasks having a priority state which is enabled by buttons inside the task. The tasks have inside a delete button as well. 
  With this todo web app there are also 2 filter buttons, one which shows only tasks with the completed status, the other button shows only tasks with the priority status and then there is one final button that shows gets rid of the filter that is being displayed and shows all the tasks.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
